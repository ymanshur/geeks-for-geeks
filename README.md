# GeeksforGeeks Solutions

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to various GeeksforGeeks Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, organized by the level of difficulty.

Created using [GfG To GitHub](https://github.com/AtharvaNanavate/GfG-To-GitHub)

## Background

This is one of the platforms that I have been using recently to sharpen my skills in DSA, mainly using Java and Python programming languages. One of the reasons why I use this platform is that it has an official editorial page for each problem, allowing me to learn more about how to solve the problem from the naive approach to the expected approach. I am also quite comfortable and satisfied with the order of topics and leveling that is structured as a tutorial or course.

I would personally recommend this platform to encourage systematic SDA learning with good solution documentation compared to platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and more complete than [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io).

For interview preparation needs, I would recommend using [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com/), which specifically provides this package for free. Here's the solution I wrote https://github.com/ymanshur/hackerrank.

Thanks for visiting this repo.
